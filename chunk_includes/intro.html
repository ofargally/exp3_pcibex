<h3><b>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH STUDY:</b></h3>
<p>
The goal of this research study is to investigate how humans and AI systems represent and process sentences.
</p>
<h3><b>PROCEDURES:</b></h3>
<p>
You will be asked to read or listen to partial or full sentences, after which you will be asked to 
do one or several of the following: respond to questions about what you read, judge how “natural” the 
sentences sounded, generate continuations to the sentences or select the best image or paraphrase that 
describes what you read. Depending on the experiment, you might also be presented with an image and asked 
to describe the image. The sentences may be in English or a made-up language that you will  learn during 
the experiment. The experiment involves a single session that will take up to an hour; there will be up to 
five sessions, but most participants will only participate in a single session. The experimenter will explain 
the specifics of the current experiment if you consent to participate.

Some participants will have their eye movements tracked as they read the texts; this will be indicated to those 
participants both when they are recruited and immediately before the experiment.
</p>
<h3><b>RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:</b></h3>
<p>
The risks associated with participation in this study are no greater than those encountered in
daily life.
</p>
<h3><b>BENEFITS:</b></h3>
<p>
There are no direct benefits to you from participating in the	study. The study may benefit society 
if it leads to a better understanding of how humans and AI models process sentences.
</p>
<h3><b>VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND RIGHT TO WITHDRAW:</b></h3>
<p>
Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary: You choose whether to participate. If you
decide not to participate, there are no penalties, and you will not lose any benefits to which you
would otherwise be entitled.
</p>
<p>If you choose to participate in the study, you can stop your participation at any time, without any
penalty or loss of benefits. If you want to withdraw from the study, please just close the window in which
you are taking the survey.</p>
<h3><b>CONFIDENTIALITY:</b></h3>
Any study records that identify you will be kept confidential to the extent possible by law. The
records from your participation may be reviewed by people responsible for making sure that
research is done properly, including members of the Institutional Review Board at Colgate University and 
officials from government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the Office for Human 
Research Protections. (All of these people are required to keep your identity confidential.) Otherwise, 
records that identify you will be available only to people working on the study, unless you give permission 
for other people to see the records. Any study records that include your name will be kept in a locked file 
cabinet. On all records of test results we will use a code number rather than your name.
<h3><b>COMPENSATION:</b></h3>
You will be compensated through Prolific upon completing this study and entering the completion code.
<h3><b>IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS:</b></h3>
<p>You can ask questions about this research study now or at any time during the study, by talking
to the researcher(s) working with you or by emailing Dr. Grusha Prasad at gprasad@colgate.edu</p>
<p>If you have questions about your rights as a research participant or feel that you have not been
treated fairly, please email the Chair of the Institutional Review Board at Colgate University at

<h3><b>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH STUDY:</b></h3>
The goal of the project is to measure what makes particular aspects of language easier or harder to learn and understand. There are two parts in this study. In the first part you will be reading sentences (presented one word at a time) and answering questions about these sentences. In the second part you will be presented strings of characters and you have to determine if these are real words in English. 

<h3><b>RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:</b></h3>
The risks associated with participation in this study are no greater than those encountered in
daily life.
<h3><b>BENEFITS:</b></h3>
There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study. This study may benefit
society if the results lead to a better understanding of what makes certain aspects of language
easier or harder to learn and understand.
<h3><b>VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND RIGHT TO WITHDRAW:</b></h3>
<p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary: You choose whether to participate. If you
decide not to participate, there are no penalties, and you will not lose any benefits to which you
would otherwise be entitled.</p>
<p>If you choose to participate in the study, you can stop your participation at any time, without any
penalty or loss of benefits. If you want to withdraw from the study, please just close the window in which
you are taking the survey.</p>
<h3><b>CONFIDENTIALITY:</b></h3>
Any study records that identify you will be kept confidential to the extent possible by law. The
records from your participation may be reviewed by people responsible for making sure that
research is done properly, including members of the Institutional Review Board at Colgate University and 
officials from government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the Office for Human 
Research Protections. (All of these people are required to keep your identity confidential.) Otherwise, 
records that identify you will be available only to people working on the study, unless you give permission 
for other people to see the records. Any study records that include your name will be kept in a locked file 
cabinet. On all records of test results we will use a code number rather than your name.
<h3><b>COMPENSATION:</b></h3>
If you satisfactorily complete the study, you will receive either course credit or payment of
$10.00 per session. Participants tested in short online sessions will be compensated in
proportion to the length of the session
<h3><b>IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS:</b></h3>
<p>You can ask questions about this research study now or at any time during the study, by talking
to the researcher(s) working with you or by emailing Dr. Grusha Prasad at gprasad@colgate.edu</p>
<p>If you have questions about your rights as a research participant or feel that you have not been
treated fairly, please email the Chair of the Institutional Review Board at Colgate University at 
IRB_chair@psych.colgate.edu</p>
